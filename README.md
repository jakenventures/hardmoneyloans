> **The ultimate suite of deal analyzers, hard money calculators, and DSCR tools for real estate investors.**

## 📖 Project Overview
**The REI Dashboard** is an open-source collection of financial modeling tools designed for the modern real estate investor. Whether you are executing a **BRRRR strategy**, analyzing a **fix and flip**, or building a rental portfolio, accurate numbers are the difference between a profitable deal and a financial disaster.

This project is built and maintained by **[Jaken Finance Group](https://jakenfinancegroup.com)**, a premier private money and hard money brokerage. We built the tools we wished we had when we started—and we use the same math to underwrite the loans we fund.

## 🛠️ The Tools: Analyze Deals Like a Lender

The code in this repository powers the live tools at [thereidashboard.com](https://thereidashboard.com). Below is a breakdown of how each tool works and the financial formulas involved.

### 1. Fix and Flip Deal Analyzer
A comprehensive calculator to determine the **Net Profit**, **Return on Investment (ROI)**, and **Maximum Allowable Offer (MAO)** for rehab projects.

* **Why it matters:** Most investors underestimate holding costs. This tool accounts for loan interest, closing costs, insurance, and utilities during the rehab phase.
* **Key SEO Features:** Calculates the "70% Rule" automatically to help you make competitive yet safe offers.
* **Lender Insight:** At Jaken Finance Group, we look for a healthy spread between your total cost basis (Purchase + Rehab) and the After Repair Value (ARV).

### 2. DSCR Loan Calculator (Rental Property Cash Flow)
Designed for landlords using the **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)** lending model. This tool answers the question: *Does the property's income cover the debt?*

* **The Formula:** $$DSCR = \frac{\text{Gross Monthly Rent}}{\text{PITIA (Principal + Interest + Taxes + Insurance + HOA)}}$$
* **Why it matters:** DSCR loans do **not** require personal income verification or tax returns. Qualification is based entirely on the property's cash flow.
* **Target Ratio:** A DSCR of **1.0** means you are breaking even. Most lenders (including us) prefer a ratio of **1.20** or higher to ensure positive cash flow.

### 3. Rehab & Construction Estimator
A line-item budgeter for estimating renovation costs before you buy.

* **Functionality:** Break down costs by category (Demolition, HVAC, Roofing, Flooring) to create a "Scope of Work."
* **Lender Insight:** When applying for a hard money loan, a detailed Scope of Work is required to get your construction draws approved. This tool formats your budget exactly how lenders want to see it.

### 4. BRRRR Strategy Calculator
For investors who Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, and Repeat.

* **Functionality:** Connects the "Flip" phase to the "Rental" phase, calculating how much cash you can pull out during the refinance to recycle your capital into the next deal.

## 💡 Hard Money & Private Equity Education

If you are using these tools, you are likely looking for capital to scale your portfolio. Understanding the **Hard Money** landscape is critical.

### What is a Hard Money Loan?
Hard money is a form of short-term, **asset-based lending**. Unlike traditional bank loans that focus on your personal Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio, hard money lenders focus on the **collateral**—the property itself.

* **Speed:** We can close in as little as 7–10 days.
* **Leverage:** We fund the purchase *and* 100% of the renovation costs.
* **Liquidity:** Keeps your cash free for other deals.
